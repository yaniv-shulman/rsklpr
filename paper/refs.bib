 abstract = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallow's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

abstract = {Nonparametric regression methods provide an alternative approach to parametric estimation that requires only weak identification assumptions and thus minimizes the risk of model misspecification. In this article, we survey some nonparametric regression techniques, with an emphasis on kernel‐based estimation, that are additionally robust to atypical and outlying observations. While the main focus lies on robust regression estimation, robust bandwidth selection and conditional scale estimation are discussed as well. Robust estimation in popular nonparametric models such as additive and varying‐coefficient models is summarized too. The performance of the main methods is demonstrated on a real dataset.This article is categorized under: Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis &gt; Robust MethodsStatistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis &gt; Nonparametric MethodsEffects of outliers on robust and non‐robust nonparametric estimators. image image},

 abstract = {Weighted local regression, a popular technique for smoothing scatterplots, is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to certain kernel smoothers. Since both methods are local weighted averages of the data, it is proved that in the fixed design regression model, given a weighted local regression procedure with any weight function, there is a corresponding kernel method such that the quotients of weights distributed by both methods tend uniformly to 1 as the number of observations increases to infinity. It is demonstrated by examples that in some instances the weights are nearly the same for both methods, even for small samples. The asymptotic equivalence allows the derivation of the leading terms of the mean squared error and of the local limit distribution for weighted local regression. Further, a close correspondence is found between the orders of the polynomial to be locally fitted in weighted local regression and the order (number of vanishing moments) of the kernel employed in the kernel smoother and between the shapes of the kernel and the weight function.},

abstract = {Nonparametric regression models offer a way to understand and quantify relationships between variables without having to identify an appropriate family of possible regression functions. Although many estimation methods for these models have been proposed in the literature, most of them can be highly sensitive to the presence of a small proportion of atypical observations in the training set. A review of outlier robust estimation methods for nonparametric regression models is provided, paying particular attention to practical considerations. Since outliers can also influence negatively the regression estimator by affecting the selection of bandwidths or smoothing parameters, a discussion of robust alternatives for this task is also included. Using many of the “classical” nonparametric regression estimators (and their robust counterparts) can be very challenging in settings with a moderate or large number of explanatory variables, so recently proposed robust nonparametric regression methods that scale well with a growing number of covariates are also discussed.}
